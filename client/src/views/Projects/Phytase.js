                    <p>Phytase is an enzyme used in the processing of animal feed and food in order to increase nutrient availability by breaking down phytate, a non-accessible form of phosphorus with antinutrient properties. By adding phytase to animal feed, phosphorus, iron, zinc and calcium are made more bioavailable and less inorganic mineral additions to feed are needed. Not only does this shrink the costs of processing animal feed, it also decreases environmental eutrophication by reducing the amount of nutrients released through waste and contaminating the environment.</p>

                    <p>At BioTork, we have used our technology to develop a more efficient and cost-effective manner by which to produce phytase enzyme. In addition, we have been granted a worldwide, exclusive license from the University of Florida to access an extremely heat tolerant phytase. This is extremely significant because the major challenge encountered when using phytase is that, like most enzymes, it is deactivated by the high temperatures used in the processing of animal feed.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>A low-cost source of heat-tolerant phytase enzymes that are unaffected by processing conditions, as BioTork is working to create, will have a huge beneficial impact on the production of animal feed, and consequently, our planet.</p>
