                    <p class="center-txt ">In recent decades, there has been a shift towards emphasizing an increase in the consumption of oils rich in omega-3 fatty acids, as they have been shown to confer established health benefits when added to the diet. The fatty acids docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) form the pillars of what is known as the “omega-3 oil” market. Not surprisingly, consumer demand for these fatty acids continues to grow.</p>

                <div class="heading-detail text-center">
                    <p class="center-txt ">Unfortunately, the main source of DHA and EPA is fish oil obtained by processing wild caught forage fish  The main source of DHA and EPA is fish oil obtained by processing wild caught forage fish, and the fisheries that produce fish oil are either saturated or declining, meaning that we are extracting as much omega-3 oils as we can from the ocean.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="heading-detail text-center">
                    <p class="center-txt ">The solution to the supply issue is to find non-animal sources of omega-3 oils, and many companies are turning to the culture of algae for the industrial production of DHA and EPA. BioTork has developed a suite of DHA-producing algae that are unique and valuable. These strains can functionally replace fish oil in a variety of nutraceutical, pharmaceutical, food and feed applications by:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Producing an omega-3 rich oil that is as high as 50% DHA.</li>
                        <li>Using low-value agroindustrial waste and byproducts as feedstock for the algae, thereby reducing cost and increasing sustainability, giving BioTork a competitive advantage.</li>
                        <li>Producing an oil that without heavy metals, like mercury, that are present in fish oils</li>
                        <li>Being both non-GMO and vegan, allowing for penetration into new omega-3 markets.</li>
                        <li>Allowing for the possibility of producing an organic product as a replacement for fish oil.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div>In short, BioTork is striving to deliver a low-cost, non-GMO, vegan source of omega-3 oils that reduces the over-fishing threatening our ecosystems today.</div>
