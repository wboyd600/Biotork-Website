There are two fundamental contributors to productivity and they are growth rate and metabolic flux. Obviously, it is the cellular factory and the enzymes contained therein that make the desired end product. Thus, the faster the cellular factory grows and makes the required enzymes the faster it will make product. Furthermore, the flux of carbon source from feedstock to product can be improved in such a way that productivity can be increased without increasing growth rate. The functional implications of improved productivity are profound. A 50% improvement in productivity means that a biorefinery can make 2 times more product without installing any new capital equipment. BioTorkâ€™s evolutionary optimization technology is ideal for improving growth rates and metabolic flux, thereby improving productivity.</p>
