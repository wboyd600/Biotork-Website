                    <p class="center-txt ">Very often microbial cellular factories work beautifully under the optimal conditions in the lab, however, more often than not, these microbes never make it out of the lab and into production. This is because the conditions in the lab are usually ideal in terms of temperature, pressure, pH control and aeration rates. Yet, on the industrial scale, it can often be impossible to control these factors from batch to batch, or even spatially within a single batch due to the large size of industrial fermenters. BioTorkâ€™s evolutionary optimization technology is an effective tool for adapting cellular factories to the unique conditions associated with industrial fermentations. This technology allows microbes to perform at suboptimal temperatures and pH values as well as to tolerate more or less aeration as the situation requires. The result is a seamless and rapid scale up from the lab scale to the industrial scale.</p>
