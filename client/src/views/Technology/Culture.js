                    <p class="center-txt "> Cellular factories are essentially agglomerations of enzymatic catalysts that convert substrate into product. In theory, increasing the production of cellular biomass increases the amount of biocatalyst. And when the biocatalyst has a finite lifetime, as is often the case with enzymes under industrial conditions, it is critical to make as much catalyst (biomass) as possible so to increase titer and productivity. In other situations, the cellular biomass is itself the desired end product, meaning increased culture densities, by definition, increase product. There is another consideration as well, often industrial processes are limited by the presence of toxins, whose toxicity is a function of how much toxin is present per cell biomass. Often, toxins are less growth inhibitory in dense cultures due mass action effects. Thus, the ability to produce dense cultures can positively affect things like production in metabolite inhibition. BioTorkâ€™s evolutionary optimization technology is ideally suited for the selection of increased cell density.</p>
