                    <p class="center-txt ">Product yield, also known as stoichiometric yield, is a measure of the efficiency of conversion of feedstock to product. A 50% conversion means that for every metric ton of feedstock used, 500 kg of product are produced. For every product and feedstock there is a theoretical maximum yield. For example, for the conversion of sugar to ethanol the theoretical maximum yield is 51%, however, most industrial ethanol producers get a yield of 45-48%. This is due to inefficiencies in the process and the production of off-target products like biomass and other metabolites. The increase in flux to the desired end product will increase product yield and, subsequently, titer and productivity. Evolutionary optimization is an excellent way to improve stoichiometric yield, especially when product synthesis is tied to growth.</p>
